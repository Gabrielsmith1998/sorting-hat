## Hogwarts Sorting Hat

## Project Overview:
Creating a application that brings up a form upon a button click.
When the form appears then the user can enter a new name into the form and press submit to sort given value into the student array and assign a random Hogwarts house. When sorted into the array the user should then be able to press the given button to expel that student from Hogwarts and into a second array Voldy’s army.
